  <h2>What I’m Currently Learning</h2>
  <p>I’m self-taught when it comes to programming. At the moment, I’m putting all my energy into learning <strong>Python</strong> and mastering <strong>Vim</strong>, with the goal of eventually using both in a professional context. It’s a  challenge, but one I believe I can overcome. And if I do – the sky’s the limit. </p>
  <h2>What I’m Reading</h2>
  <p>I usually have two books on the go at once – one technical, and one for pleasure. I take my time with the technical ones, and I certainly don’t get through them quickly. Right now, I’m working my way through <strong>The Python Standard Library</strong> by Doug Hellmann. It’s tough going. </p>
  <p>My fiction / non-fiction picks tend to be page-turners. A recent standout was <strong>Killing Thatcher</strong> by Rory Carroll – an excellent, detailed book that reads like a thriller. </p>
  <p>The most useful book I’ve read so far in 2025 is <strong>Outlines</strong> by Sextus Empiricus. I studied Pyrrhonism at university many years ago, but only now am I beginning to grasp just how practical this philosophy is. </p>
  <h2>What I’m Currently Listening To</h2>
  <p>Most recently: <strong>Wall of Eyes</strong> and <strong>Cutouts</strong> by The Smile – both brilliant. </p>
