      <h2>A Strategic Pivot</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">From Human Risk to Human-Centered Technology</p>
    </header>
    <div class="grid">
      <div>
        <p>I bring <strong>20+ years of experience</strong> at the intersection of psychology, law, and people risk — now transitioning into a <strong>technology-focused practice</strong>. </p>
        <p>My career began in corporate psychology as <strong>Head of Psychological Services</strong> at Ukraine’s largest commercial bank, where I built and led the psychological risk unit. I designed a large-scale screening program, led a cross-regional team, and conducted behavioral evaluations for high-risk roles. I also advised executive leadership on people risks and contributed to internal investigations and fraud prevention efforts. </p>
        <p>In 2010, I founded <strong>Psiwell</strong>, a consulting firm specializing in human risk and organizational psychology. I advised clients on people strategy, risk, and performance; applied people analytics to support data-driven decisions; and led major HR and change initiatives, including M&A integrations and policy design. I also trained polygraph operators and earned legal qualifications to support compliance work. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Following the escalation of the war in Ukraine and a serious health setback, I reevaluated how to apply my background more sustainably and at scale. I transitioned into <strong>technology</strong> — applying programming and data analysis to address challenges in behavioral risk, ethical system design, and human-centered decision-making. </p>
        <p>
          <mark>My current focus</mark> is <strong>Python development</strong>, using <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, and <strong>NumPy</strong> to build tools that integrate psychological insight into digital services. I also work with <strong>accessible HTML and CSS</strong> for inclusive, user-friendly design, and apply <strong>natural language processing</strong> for structured text analysis and behavioral insight.
        </p>
        <p>In parallel, I practice <em>Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT)</em> — a short-term, goal-oriented, evidence-based model focused on practical change. Its emphasis on clarity, minimalism, and future orientation shapes how I build <strong>user-facing applications</strong> for behavioral feedback, adaptive interfaces, and decision support systems. </p>
