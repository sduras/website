      <h2>A Strategic Pivot</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">From Human Risk to Human-Centered Technology</p>
    </header>
    <p>I bring two decades of experience at the intersection of psychology, law, and organizational risk — now evolving into a new chapter focused on technology and programming.</p>
    <p>With a Master’s in Psychology and a Bachelor’s in Law, my career began in corporate psychology, where I led high-stakes personnel assessments, built risk mitigation frameworks, and advised executive leadership in Ukraine’s largest commercial bank. My work was not only about understanding people — it was about protecting organization by applying deep behavioral insights to real-world systems. </p>
    <p>In 2010, I founded and ran a consulting firm dedicated to human risk and organizational psychology. For over a decade, I worked with major clients on leadership evaluation, post-incident interventions, and people-related risks in M&A transactions. Along the way, I also trained polygraph examiners, earned legal qualifications to support regulatory compliance, and stepped in as interim Chief People Officer for a regional HR transformation initiative. </p>
    <p>When Russia attacked Ukraine and the war escalated, like many, I faced profound disruption. I transitioned into humanitarian work as an HR Coordinator with an international NGO — continuing to apply my expertise in human systems under extraordinary circumstances. A serious health issue soon followed, prompting both personal and professional reassessment. </p>
    <p>Rather than returning to the status quo, I chose to redirect.</p>
    <p>Today, I’m focusing on computer programming and Python development — not as a break from my past, but as a strategic evolution of it. I see enormous potential in using technology to address complex human challenges, especially in areas like behavioral data, people risk modeling, and ethical system design. My goal is to integrate my background into this new path, bringing human insight into digital solutions.</p>

    <h2>Education & Training</h2>
    <p>I hold a Master’s degree with Honours in Psychology and a Bachelor’s degree in Law from <a href="https://karazin.ua/en/fakulteti-ta-instituti/psikhologiyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kharkiv University</a>. My academic background has always reflected a strong interest in the psychological and philosophical dimensions of human behavior — especially in high-stakes or complex environments. </p>
    <p>To deepen my clinical and theoretical expertise, I completed a five-year professional training program in Group Analytic Psychotherapy. This program, jointly accredited by the <a href="https://www.europsyche.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Association for Psychotherapy</a> (EAP) and the <a href="https://usp.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukrainian Umbrella Association of Psychotherapists</a> (UUAP), met European standards for supervised practice, theory, and personal development. It qualifies me to apply for the European Certificate of Psychotherapy. </p>
    <p>Following my graduate studies in Psychology, I pursued postgraduate research at the <a href="https://karazin.ua/en/fakulteti-ta-instituti/filosofskii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Philosophy</a> at Kharkiv University, with a focus on psycho-analytic theories of aggression and war. I later joined the Department of Theoretical and Practical Philosophy as a lecturer, combining academic rigor with a practical commitment to applied psychology. </p>

    <h2>Corporate Practice & Risk Psychology</h2>
    <p>In 2003, I joined <a href="https://privatbank.ua/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrivatBank</a> — then Ukraine’s largest commercial bank — as Head of Psychological Services, where I built and led a department that played a central role in the bank’s people risk management: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and implementing a large-scale psychodiagnostic screening program assessing over 15,000 individuals annually.</li>
      <li>Leading and mentoring a cross-regional team of 25 psychologists.</li>
      <li>Conducting individual evaluations for high-risk roles in IT, security, and finance.</li>
      <li>Advising on psychological risk within internal investigations and fraud prevention programs.</li>
      <li>Providing strategic guidance to executive leadership on people issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under my leadership, psychological screening became a formal part of the bank’s approach to vetting employees in sensitive roles. This was not traditional HR; it was a specialized function embedded within the bank’s risk infrastructure — using behavioral science to protect assets, ensure long-term reliability, and uphold institutional integrity.</p>

    <h2>Polygraph & Forensic Psychophysiology</h2>
    <p>To enhance the forensic dimension of my work, I completed advanced polygraph examiner training in the United States. The program met the rigorous standards of the American Polygraph Association (APA), the American Association of Police Polygraphists (AAPP), and relevant state licensing boards. Its curriculum was modeled after the U.S. Department of Defense Polygraph Institute (DoDPI). </p>
    <p>Over the following two decades, I conducted more than 2,000 polygraph examinations and trained over 70 examiners, helping to build professional capacity in Ukraine and beyond. While I have since developed a more critical view of the method and no longer incorporate polygraph into my professional practice, this phase of my career provided valuable insight into forensic psychophysiology, behavioral detection, and decision-making under uncertainty — all of which continue to inform my data-oriented approach today.</p>

    <h2>Consulting & People Risk Advisory</h2>
    <p>In 2010, I founded a specialist consulting firm focused on human risk and organisational psychology. Over more than a decade, I worked closely with corporate clients navigating complex people challenges, often at times of change or strategic vulnerability.</p>
    <p>My advisory services included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Organisational Assessment</strong>: Leading psychodiagnostic reviews and post-incident evaluations to enhance workforce resilience and reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HR Consultancy</strong>: Supporting the development and rollout of people policies, especially in areas related to compliance, ethics, and behavioral risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Human Due Diligence in M&A</strong>: Helping clients identify and manage people-related risks during acquisitions, integrations, and leadership transitions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To support this work, I completed a Bachelor of Laws degree, which enhanced my ability to navigate regulatory frameworks and national labour law requirements.</p>
    <p>In 2019, I partnered with a <a href="https://ttn.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading EMEA-region travel platform</a> to support an ambitious HR transformation project. I stepped in as Interim Chief People Officer, leading a people analytics–driven initiative designed to reshape culture, structure, and talent practices. While the project gained strong initial traction, it was eventually paused due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

    <h2>Recent Work & Career Transition</h2>
    <p>When full-scale war escalated in Ukraine, my consulting business faced inevitable disruption. I transitioned into the humanitarian sector as an HR Coordinator for <a href="https://www.nrc.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norwegian Refugee Council</a>, where I supported emergency response efforts as an HR Coordinator for Western Ukraine. </p>
    <p>“During this time, I faced a significant health challenge that required surgery and an extended period of recovery. This experience led me to profoundly reassess how I work and the kind of professional future I wish to pursue.</p>
    <p>Rather than returning to my previous roles, I chose to adapt—shifting towards technology as a means to apply my analytical skills more flexibly and sustainably. Today, I focus on Python programming and exploring how technology can be harnessed to address behavioural, ethical, and organisational challenges at scale. I view this as a natural extension of my lifelong work: translating complex human dynamics into actionable, evidence-based systems.</p>
